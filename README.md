# Snake Water Gun Game in C

This is a simple Snake-Water-Gun game written in C.  
I created this project while learning from CodeWithHarry's C programming tutorial on YouTube.

## About the Game

- The player chooses one of the three options: Snake (0), Water (1), or Gun (2).
- The computer randomly selects its option.
- The result is then printed as:
  - You win
  - You lose
  - It's a tie

## How I Made It

I followed the tutorial by CodeWithHarry to understand the logic and code.  
This helped me learn:
- Random number generation using rand()
- If-else conditions
- Basic C syntax and structure

## Credits

This project is based on CodeWithHarry's tutorial.  
It is made only for learning and practice purposes.

## How to Run

1. Use any C compiler like GCC.
2. Compile the code using:
